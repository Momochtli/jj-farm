# An application of NEAT in flappy bird
 
When my friend and I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) video about a neural network evolving to beat a level in super mario we were amazed and thought how cool it would be to make something similar. At the same time we were tasked at our college to make a program using some form of artificial intelligence. The game was on.

This is a dumbed down version of NEAT that still needs speciation so the network could do crossover. Because of this it will sometimes converge on a local optimum. But when it converges on a global optimum it easily passes over 50 columns.
